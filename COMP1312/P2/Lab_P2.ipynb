    "- Understand functions, how to define and call functions\n",
    "- Understand lists and operations on lists including list comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you complete this laboratory, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Write a simple program using loops to model repetitive behaviours\n",
    "- Write a program with functions to have better code structures with correct type annotations.\n",
    "- Utilise the list data structure and use operators to update lists.\n",

You can refer to the logbook in the future, e.g., to remind you about the procedures or how you overcome problems. As such, it should be legible, and the notes should be clearly referenced to the appropriate part of the lab. You will be informed when yoshouldst makenry entry in your logbook. However, you are encouraged to record additional entries, especially when something unexpected occurs, or when you discover something of interest.\n",

    "#### 3.1.3. Working with Lists\n",
    "Lists are a fundamental data-structure in Python, and it is important to know how to interact with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `for` Loops\n",
    "The `for` loop allows you to run the same block of code potentially many times but with different values drawn from a collection. We've already seen looping over a range (e.g. to count from `1` through `7`), but the `for` loop will allow us to loop over other types as well. We can, for example, loop over a list of resident species of Columbid in the UK, printing them out in a nice bulleted list.\n",
    "```\n",
    "columbid_species = [\"Rock Dove\", \"Stock Dove\", \"Wood Pigeon\", \"Turtle Dove\"]\n",

    "for species in columbid_species:\n",
    "    print(\" - \" + species)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Mutability\n",
    "Strings and integers are immutable: once you create a string object it can not change: you may change which object is recorded by a variable, but not an immutable object itself. Lists, however, are mutable: we can change the object itself. We can, for example, add a new species to our list, to record that the Collared Dove is now a resident as well:\n",
    "```\n",
    "columbid_species.append(\"Collared Dove\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Often we don't know what will be in a list when we first create it, so we may start with an empty list and add to that.\n",

    "swan_species.append(\"Black Swan\")\n",
    "swan_species.append(\"Mute Swan\")\n",

    "swan_species.append(\"Whistling Swan\")\n",
    "swan_species.append(\"Trumpeter Swan\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can also remove elements from the list, either by value or index.\n",
    "```\n",
    "swan_species.pop(0)  # remove first element of list\n",
    "swan_species.pop(len(swan_species) - 1)  # remove last element of list\n",
    "swan_species.remove(\"Whistling Swan\")  # remove an element by value\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "- Must loop over the elements of the source list, and append any element that ends with \"Dove\" to the destination list\n",

    "- Should add the new elements in the same order they appear in the source list\n",
