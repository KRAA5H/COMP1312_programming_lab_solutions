    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "### 1.1. Aims and Learning Outcomes\n",
    "This laboratory aims to:\n",
    "- Understand how to initialise, access, update, and remove elements in Python dictionaries.\n",
    "- Understand techniques for iterating over dictionaries and managing nested dictionaries.\n",
    "- Understand how to manipulate ragged lists through flattening, element access, and calculating statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you complete this laboratory, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Use Python dictionaries for organising and managing key-value pairs, including handling nested dictionaries and avoiding `KeyErrors`.\n",
    "- Write functions that flatten ragged lists, access elements at specific indices, and compute statistics such as the sum and average of list elements.\n",
    "- Implement proper error handling for invalid inputs, ensuring robust and reliable code.\n",
    "- Use PyCharm to develop, debug, and test Python programs, including utilising its syntax highlighting, type checking, and debugging tools to enhance code quality.\n",

You can refer to the logbook in the future, e.g., to remind you about the procedures or how you overcame problems. As such, it should be legible, and the notes should be clearly referenced to the appropriate part of the lab. You will be informed when you should make an entry in your logbook. However, you are encouraged to record additional entries, especially when something unexpected occurs or when you discover something of interest.\n",

    "- Interactive debugging, which allows you to inspect the state of a running program.\n",
